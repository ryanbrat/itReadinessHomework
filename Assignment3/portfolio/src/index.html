      <p>This is my good side. After 10 years in the automotive industry as an ASE certified master technician I decided it was time for a change. On a recommendation from a friend I started learning html and css in February of 2017 with online resources like
        <a href="codecademy.com">codecademy.com</a>. This was a great start but recently I was accepted into an IT readiness course at the University of Arkansas. This opportunity has greatly excelled my learning. My instructor, Mr. Worthy is a great teacher.
        I'm not just saying this to get a good grade! While my background may not be in computer technology I believe I have a mind for problem solving and a history of repairing automotive electronics. My long term goal is to combine my experiences to work with self driving car technology. I'm excited to see where this path will lead me!</p>

    <div class="radSide">
      <p>This is my rad side. I have been a musician, a mechanic, and an auto enthusiast. But one of my greatest passions is biking. Shortly after getting into mountain biking with my father at a young age I discovered trials. This form of biking
        is obstacle oriented and requires precision, balance and power. I loved the challenge and began competing at a young age. This experience and over 10 years of training has earned me the current two time national champion title. But for me it doesn't
        end there. Over the years I have performed stunts shows at different festivals and events, and noticed young kids reaction is almost always, "WOW!". I realized I could combine a positive message with my stunt show to inspire the next generation.
        Over the past few years I have begun booking school presentations, this is where I want to shift my focus as a rider.</p>
