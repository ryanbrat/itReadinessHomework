      <p>This is my good side. After 10 years in the automotive industry as an ASE certified master technician I decided it was time for a change. On a reccomendation from a friend I started learning html and css in Febuary of 2017 with online recources like
        <a href="codecademy.com">codecademy.com</a>. This was a great start but recently I was accepted into an IT readiness course at the University of Arkansas. This opportunity has greatly accelled my learning. My insructor, Mr. Worthy is a great teacher.
        I'm not just saying this to get a good grade! While my background may not be in computer technoligy I believe I have a mind for problem solving and a history of repairing automotive electronics. I'm excited to see where this path will lead me!</p>

    <div class="radSide">
      <p>This is my rad side. I have been a musician, a mechanic, an auto enthusiast and underwear model. But my greatest passion is biking. Shortly after getting into mountain biking with my father at a young age I discovered trials. This form of biking
        is obstacle oriented and requires precicion, balance and power. I loved the challenge and began competing at a young age. This experience and over 10 years of training has earned me the current two time national champion title. But for me it doesn't
        end there. Over the years I have performed stunts shows at different festivals and events, and noticed young kids reaction is almost universally, "WOW!". I realized I could combine a positive message with my stunt show to inspire the next generation.
        Over the past few years I have begun booking school presentations, this is where I want to shift my focus as a rider.</p>
